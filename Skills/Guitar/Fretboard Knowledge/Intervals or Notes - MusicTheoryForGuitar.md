- Do I use intervals or notes to find a scale/chord
- Patterns of intervals are the same, just have to move it up and down
	- Thus, guitar players can more easily think in visual patterns rather than notes
- Just intervals not enough!
	- Have to decide *where* to play them
- INTEGRATE notes and intervals
	- Dont just learn each independently
- Make them become exactly the **same**
- Think G and E, **automatically** think major 6th
	- Allows use of best of both worlds
