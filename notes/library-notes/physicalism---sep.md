 Physicalism
Created: --

 Preliminaries
- Thesis: everything is of physical nature, even those things which do not appear to be so, such as politics, psychology, or mathematics
- "Materialism" first appeared in the late th century as a metaphysical doctrine, whereas "physicalism" first appeared in the s as a linguistic doctrine associated with [[Positivism]]
	- Today, the two terms are used interchangeably
- Physicalism appears to be a metaphysical thesis which goes all the way back to [[Democritus]], and later being held by early modern philosophers such as [[Hobbes]]
	- But we must be careful because the notion of "physicality" has changed much throughout history, so their conceptions of "physicalism" may differ greatly
- Two questions about Physicalism:
	. What do it mean for something to be physical 
	. Is it the case that everything is physical
 Is everything physical?
 Modal formulations of Physicalism
 Supervenience Physicalism
- Physicalism supposes that the psychological/political/biological components are our world [[supervenience|supervene]] on physicality
	- Dot matrix analogy
		- ![[depositphotos_-stock-illustration-halftone-dots-radial-with-shadow.webp|]]
		- Dot matrix has general properties such as "symmetry" or "roundness" which supervene on the dots
			- Two dot matrices have identical general properties if and only if the individual dots which constitute them are identical
- () Thus, if everything is physical ->
	- then every possible world physically identical to ours must be psychological/politically/biologically identical to ours
- Objection
	- The sufficiency problem argues:
		- () is a necessary property but not a sufficient one in proving physicalism
		- A singleton set which contains only Socrates has supervening properties (properties of the set) which are fundamentally different than Socrates himself
	- This leads to necessitation dualism, which claims that mental properties supervene on physical properties, but are nevertheless ontologically distinct
		- Apparently violates Hume's dictum: there are no necessary connections between distinct ontological categories
 Necessity Physicalism
- If everything is physical ->
	- then every property in our world is ultimately necessitated by a physical property (it is entailed by)
 Identity Physicalism
- Two types:
	- Token physicalism
		- Every particular in the world is identical to a physical particular
		- Not sufficient or necessary, because there are some particulars which are not identical to physical particulars (those non-identical particulars may still [[Supervenience Physicalism|supervene]] on physical particulars)
		- Compatible with [[property dualism]] which says all particulars are physical, but some have psychological [[🎓 Properties - IEP|properties]], which are distinct from physical properties
		- Incompatible with [[substance dualism]] which says particulars can either be physical or non-physical
	- Type physicalism
		- Every property in the world is IDENTICAL to a physical property
