- Traditional logic holds a proposition to be an assertion
- Modern logic holds a proposition to be the meaning of an assertion (?)

- Categorical proposition: An assertion which contains a predicate asserting something about a subject
- A categorical proposition can be divided into  forms:
	- (A) Universal affirmative (All S is P)
	- (E) Universal negative (No S is P)
	- (I) Particular affirmative (Some S is P)
	- (O) Particular negative (Some S is not P)

- Contrariety of two propositions
	- Can not be true simultaneously  
	- Can be false simultaneously
- Subcontrariety of two propositions
	- Can be true simultaneously
	- Can not be false simultaneously
- Subimplication
