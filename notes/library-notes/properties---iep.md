 Properties
Created: --

- The consensus on what properties are:
	- Properties are what makes distinct particulars qualitatively similar to one another
		- Snow, clouds, and paper all instantiate the property: being white
-  theories that try to account for properties
	. Universals
		- A transcendent (abstract existence) or immanent entity (existence only in particulars) which are instantiated in particulars
	. Tropes
		- Completely individual qualities that are instantiated only in one particular 
		- What grounds the resemblance between tropes? Cannot appeal to universals.
	. Natural classes
		- Anything which is white is contained in the natural class (a set) of "thing which are white"
		- Leads to an overpopulation problem. One particular is a member of a seemingly infinite amount of different classes
	. Resemblance classes
		- The classes each particular is a member of is determined by its resemblance relations (?) Is this similar to [[📘 Rethinking Intuition - DePaul and RamseyFamily Resemblances: Page  - Rosch and Mervis|prototypical categories]]
- Realism vs Nominalism
	- Do abstract/general/universal entities exist?
	- Or is everything merely a particular?
- The terms are ambiguous
	- If you are a "realist" you can be a realist about properties or universals
		- (?) Does this distinguish properties from universals? it seems to depend on your theory of properties
	- If you are a "nominalist" you can deny the existence of abstract objects while accepting the existence of universals or vice versa
	- This article holds nominalist to mean denying universals
- Realism/Nominalism in the context of properties
	- A realist property theory would hold a a universalist theory
	- A nominalist property theory comes in two types
		- Medium nominalism: trope theory
		- Extreme nominalism: completely denies all property-like entities
			- Position put forth by Quine completely dismisses the similarity question
- Extreme Nominalist questions how exactly universals instantiate properties, whether abstractly or immanently 
	- Ontologically mysterious
- Realist argues that the extreme Nominalist is working backwards, trying to explain the property in terms of predication, or by membership to a set, instead of the other way around (predication due to instantiating the property)
