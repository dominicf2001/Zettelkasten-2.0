 The incoherence of our ordinary intuitions
Created: --

 Part 
- Our perception of the world is not a : representation of the world outside our perception
	. If it was, we would dissolve into an anthropic soup, due to entropy
		- "Structural integrity" would not be able to be maintained due to the overwhelming amount of mirrored states
		- Our perception is a "best guess" representation
	. If it was, we would not survive natural selection ("proven mathematically")
		- Truth is 
		- not helpful for survival
		- Just as its not helpful if we worked with computers by directly manipulating them holistically at the transistor level
			- It is instead helpful to work with desktop environments which are crude representations of the transistor level
- Our perception of the world is akin to a dashboard on an airplane
	- Space-time is part of the dashboard
	- Time being part of the dashboard is supported by quantum field theory and the theory of relativity

-  What is outside our perception, the "true" nature of reality, does not have to conform to the constraints of our perception
	- "Whatever is incommensurable with our perception is inconceivable to us"
 Part 
- Kastrup claims that Physicalism maintains that what constitutes the world outside of perception is the quantitative "abstract geometric relations", which mirror the contours of objects in our perception
	- Physicalism recognizes some things are idiosyncratic, such as color (qualia)
- Kastrup objects: the contours are merely contours of the dashboard 
- Physicalism then takes these contours and quantifies them into a myriad of dimensions
	- Weight
	- Height/width
	- Degrees
	- Distance
	- Electric charge
	- Momentum
	- Force
- These are DESCRIPTIONS of the INTERFACE
- Physicalism makes a THEORETICAL POSTULATE that what lies behind our perception is purely quantitative in nature
	- Assumes that the dashboard can be exhaustively defined in these quantitative dimensions of description
- The contours as we see them are defined qualitatively by colors (black outline/white background)"
- [[‚úèÔ∏è Quantification of Perception]]
- Summary of Physicalist's flaw:
	- Start from perception (it is a given)
	- Describe this perception "accurately" using quantitative dimensions
	- Claim these quantitative dimensions are PRIOR to and GENERATE the perception
		- They are the world-in-itself
		- They generate through the medium of a brain, which is a PERCEPTION
- Equivalent to saying the territory derives from the map
- Quantitative dimensions correlate with quality precisely because they are CONSTRUCTED with reference to quality
 How does Physicalism hold up to "post-enlightenment values"?
- Logical coherence
	- No, mind is explained in terms of an abstraction of the mind
- Internal consistence
	. Matter by definition is purely quantitative
	. Matter can account for quality
	- These propositions contradict
- Conceptual parsimony
	- No, makes unnecessary postulate of another ontological category 
- Empirical adequateness
	- Becoming increasingly incompatible with observations and theories in physics (?)
	- Reductions in brain metabolism lead to INCREASED experientiality
- Explanatory power
	- No, due to the hard problem of consciousness
