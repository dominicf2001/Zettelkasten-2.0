 The Responsible Parent's Guide to Healthy Mood
Created: --

- Can happiness be chemically engineered?
- Is this necessary to reach superhuman levels of happiness?
	- This can be argued for, as our inbuilt neurochemistry and biology is not sufficient
- There is much delusion surrounding this subject
	- Laymen are subject to propaganda
	- Resources necessary for scientists are dependent on funders, therefore there is incentive to skew results to please funders
- Cocaine nor amphetamines are sufficient to create long-term boosts in happiness
	- After a short boost in mood, body returns to homeostasis (no long term increase in the level)
- Marijuana
	- Decreases CRF, which an excess of can lead to depression
		- However, the rebound correlates with increased stress
	- Rarely induces depersonalization, derealization, or psychosis
	- Affects short term memory, but increases creativity
	- Nevertheless, it seems getting high may be an innocent pass time
- Psychedelics are too unpredictable and debilitating in normal life in order to be used as a "happy drug"
	- Good trips are not guaranteed
	- Can lead to derealization or freak outs in the mentally unwell
- Drugs like MDMA achieve the desired affect (universal love, clarity, and sanity), but very often users only experience it once.
	- Additionally, the duration is too short
	- Perpetual use is unfeasible
