	- Universally accepted as earliest records of Buddha's teachings
- Theravada Buddhism
	- The oldest form
	- "Orthodox"

 The Buddhist Attitude of Mind: Page 
- The Buddha was a man, "par excellence" who merely showed and reached the path of liberation
- Man can liberate himself through his own effort/intelligence without needing a higher power external to himself, such as a God.
	- Man must be a refuge to himself
- The Five Hindrances
	- Lust
	- Ill Will
	- Doubt 
	- Physical/mental languor
	- Restlessness/worry
- Doubt is an obstacle in your path towards truth
	- Doubt must be cleared away
	- It is a pitfall to succumb to authority in order to clear doubt
- Tolerance and Understanding are primary virtues in Buddhism
	- Applies to other religions
		- To not apply to other religions is to harm yourself as well
	- Violence is very much not encouraged
		- Very little blood shed in the act of religious conversion
- Labels of truth
	- Seen as as an obstacle to truth, because it brings along prejudices
	- Therefore, the label "Buddhism" is not taken seriously
	- A rose by any other name is just as sweet
- States of nirvana
	. "Stream Entrant" (Sotapanna)
	. "Once returner" (Sakadagami)
	. "Never returner" (Anagami)
	. (Archant) - highest stage
		- Complete liberation from all desire/attachments
- Blind faith is antithetical to the Buddhas teachings

 The First Noble Truth; Dukkha: Page 
- Suffering is only one aspect of Dukkha, so "life is suffering" is a misleading interpretation of the first noble truth
	- Leads to an overly pessimistic view
- Buddhism is the middle ground between pessimism and optimism; It takes a "realistic" perspective
	- Merely recognizes your ailments and prescribes an antidote
- Dukkha takes into account suffering, change, imperfection, insubstantiality, happiness, and even higher spiritual states
	- Dukkha is all things which are impermanent
	- There are different forms of happiness
		- Happiness from being a recluse
		- Happiness from family
		- Happiness of attachment/detachment
		- Happiness of renunciation 
		- ...more
- It is vital to understand these three things about sense pleasures
	- Enjoyment
	- Unsatisfactoriness -> immoral consequence
	- Liberation
- Enjoyment of sense pleasures is impermanent. Thus, it will eventually lead to unsatisfactoriness which in turn may cause one to act irrationally/immorally/foolishly. To remain unattached to all sense pleasures is liberation
- Dukkha can be conceptualized as
	- Dukkha as ordinary suffering
	- Dukkha as caused by change/impermanence
	- Dukkha as conditioned states
- To understand Dukkha as conditioned states, you must understand the Buddhist concept of being
	- Being is constituted by the [[📃 The Five Aggregates - BBC|the Five Aggregates]]
- There is no ontological distinction between spirit and matter
	- The physical and mental are aspects of the same substance
- There are six faculties and six corresponding objects
	- Eye, ear, mouth, tongue, nose, mind
	- Visible form, sound, taste, smell, thoughts/ideas
- The Five Aggregates [[the Five Aggregates.png|Picture (seperate source)]]
	- Matter
		- The six faculties and their corresponding objects as such
	- Sensation
		- The experience generated through the contact between the six faculties and their corresponding objects
	- Perception
		- Recognition of objects as either physical or mental
	- Mental formations
		- Volitional activities each associated with one of the six faculties and their corresponding objects
		- Source of karma
		- Attention, will, determination, confidence, wisdom, energy, desire, hatred, ignorance, idea of self
	- Consciousness
		- Reaction/Response associated with one of the six faculties and their corresponding objects
		- Connected to the other aggregate
- Consciousness cannot exist apart from matter
	- Matter is its support/condition, just as a fire needs a material as the condition for its burning
- "I"/"Individual" is a label for all of the aggregates taken together
	- But none of the aggregates is permanent or the same through time 
- Experience Dukkha with patience and wisdom
- Serenity, calmness and joy and are all results of the Buddhas teachings
- There is no beginning or end to the stream of life 

 The Second Noble Truth; The arising of Dukkha : Page 
- Dukkha is primarily caused by thirst/craving/desire/attachment
	- Desire/attachment for:
		. Sense pleasures/ideas/worldviews
		. Existence
		. Non-existence (self annihilation) 
	- Thirst/craving/desire is not the only cause however
	- Desire is not a first cause
		- Infinite chain of causes ?
- Desire/craving is the root of all human strife
	- We concern ourselves we surface level issues and ignore this root cause
- Mental volition
	- It is the will to exist 
	- Synonymous with thirst/craving/attachment/desire/karma
- [[Karma]]
	- Volitional action itself (not its consequences)
	- Good karma -> good results
	- Bad karma -> bad results
	- Good and bad karma are both forces which continue Dukkha
	- An Arahant does not accumulate karma
- Karma continues after the dissolution of the physical body
	- There is no "You" which continues after death, just karma
	- Mental/volitional forces occur in a series
	- [[✏️ Thought Moment Series]]

 The Third Noble Truth; The cessation of Dukkha : Page 
- [[Nirvana]] is the cessation of Dukkha
- In order to transcend Dukkha, you must sever its root: desire/attachment
- Nirvana is absolute truth
	- The absolute truth is that nothing is absolute
- NIRVANA IS
- You do not enter Nirvana. This is a mistaken view
- What is Nirvana like?
	- Cannot be described using language
	- The best to describe it is negatively
		- It is the cessation of desire
		- Freedom from attachment
		- There is no creation/destruction
		- No birth/death
		- No duality
- Who experiences Nirvana if no permanent self?
	- Nobody experiences it, in the same way there is no thinker that thinks a thought
	- Just as the thought is simply the thought itself, Nirvana is just Nirvana itself
- Nirvana can be realized while in a physical body
	- Is Nirvana happiness?
		- "That there is no sensation itself is happiness"
 The Fourth Noble Truth; Magga; the Path : Page 
- Magga (the middle way) is the way to Nirvana
	- The Eightfold Path
	- It is between two extremes
	- [[✏️ The Middle Path Drawing]]
- Buddhist training split into three parts:
	- Ethical conduct (Universal love, compassion, tolerance)
	- Mental discipline
	- Wisdom
- Compassion and wisdom must be developed equally and simultaneously
	- Wisdom and not enough compassion leads to pride
	- Compassion and not enough wisdom leads to foolishness
- Eightfold Path:
	- ETHICAL CONDUCT
		- Right Speech
			- Speak truthfully
			- No idle gossip
			- No slander/hatred
			- "Noble silence"
		- Right Action
			- Peaceful conduct
			- No stealing
			- No destroying
			- No sexual misconduct
		- Right Livelihood
			- Avoid professions that harm others
			- Find a profession which benefits yourself and humanity
	- MENTAL DISCIPLINE
		- Right Effort
			- Rid and prevent evil/unwholesome states
			- Develop and generate good/wholesome states
		- Right Mindfulness
			- Be diligently aware of sensations, body, and thoughts as they occur
		- Right Concentration
			- Concentration leads to the  stages of Dhyana (Sometimes called "trance")
				. Riddance of unwholesome thoughts. Simply
				. Suppression of intellectual activity. A "One-pointedness" of mind. Happiness is still retained.
				. Joy disappears. Happiness + mindful equanimity // Difference between joy and happiness?
				. All sensations are gone. Merely equanimity and awareness/mindfulness remain.
	- WISDOM
		- Right Thought
			- Selfless/loving thoughts without discrimination
			- No selfish/hatred thoughts
		- Right Understanding
			- Deep knowing of the  Noble Turths (Penetration of them)
			- Two types of understanding to cultivate:
				. "Knowing accordingly"
					- Understanding of a subject based on accumulated memory of data, and relations based on that data
				. "Penetration"
					- Seeing into true nature without name or label. This requires meditation.
 The Doctrine of No-Soul; Anatta : Page 
- Soul/self/ego is called "Atman" in Sanskrit
	- It is imaginary/illusory
	- Source of all strife in the world, due to selfishness
- Human's motivation to create God is for self protection
- Human's motivation to believe in an immortal soul is for self preservation
- Buddha recognizes different stages of spiritual development
	- Just as lotus flowers in a pond float at different heights 
- [[✏️ Conditioned Genesis|Conditioned Genesis]]
	- Consider as circle, because there is no first cause
	- If everything is conditioned, then there is no free will 
-  Two types of truth:
	- "Conventional truth"
		- "I"/"me"/"self"
	- "Ultimate truth"
		- The self is an illusion
- Buddha recognizes that the truth of no soul can be frightening/tormenting
- Controversy over whether or not Buddha recognizes
	- Refuted by several passages
		- Dhammapada - Verses: , , 
		- "All dhammas are without self" 
		- Dhamma is a generalized Samkhara (five aggregates) as it includes conditioned AND unconditioned things
- Buddha rejects a permanent underlying self
	- Rejects "The universe is Atman"
- Buddha answered questions based on development/tendencies/character/intelligence
	-  ways of answering questions:
		. Directly
		. Analytically
		. Counter-questions
		. Putting the question aside
- Feeling of "I am" is not any of the  aggregates. // It is an abstraction  
	- Analogy: the smell of a flower is not the smell of the petals, or the smell of the pollen, but the smell of the flower
- Buddha says you should not take a stance between self (Eternalist) or no self (Annihalist)
	- Leads to more confusion
- If no self, who gets Karma?
	- No one, there is merely conditionality // Conditioned sense data
 "Meditation" or mental culture; Bhavana : Page 
- Two kinds of illness
	- Physical
	- Mental
- Meditation is misunderstood as only a technical ritual done in a specific context
	- "meditation" is a poor substitute for Bhavana, which means "mental culture/development"
- Two kinds of meditation
	. Concentration
		- Leads to high mystical states
			- These are not ultimate truth
			- Creates "peaceful living"
			- Mind created
	. Vipassana
		- Leads to insight into true nature
			- Nirvana/complete liberation
- Vipassana meditation
	- Fundamentally connected with daily living
	- Accounts for: Body, Feelings, Mind, and Morality/Intellectuality
	- Body Meditation (Anapanasati)
		- Cross leg/stiff posture
		- Awareness/concentration on breath
			- This concentration is required to realize Nirvana
		- Mindfulness of activities/habits throughout the day
			- Being present
			- Does not imply you should be constantly self-conscious (this is harmful)
				- Should instead be a flow state
	- Mental/Mind Meditation
		- Observation of sensations and feelings in an objective manner:
			- Their source
			- Their presence 
			- Their cessation  
		- Through mere observation/awareness, the mind will become dispassionate with certain sensations
			- Leads to freedom
		- Scientific observation rather than judgmental observation
		- Do not think of sensations/feelings as yours ("MY feeling")
	- Intellectual/Moral Meditation
		- Meditate on: (examples)
			- A book (thinking deeply about it)
			- The five hindrances
			- The seven factors of enlightenment:
				. Mindfulness
				. Research (analytical)
				. Energy
				. Joy/optimism
				. Relaxation
