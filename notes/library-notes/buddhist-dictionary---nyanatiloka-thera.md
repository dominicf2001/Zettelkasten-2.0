- Physical or mental pain
- Suffering/ill
- Not limited to pain:
	- Refers to the unsatisfactory and insecure nature of all existence. Due to the impermanence of all things, all things are liable to suffering. This means pleasurable things are accounted for.
- "If there were no satisfaction to be found in the world, beings would not be attached to the world .... If there were no misery to be found in the world, beings would not be repelled by the world .... If there were no escape from the world, beings could not escape therefrom" - (Anguttara Nikaya. , )
