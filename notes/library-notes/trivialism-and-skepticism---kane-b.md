 Trivialism and Skepticism
Created: -- :

 Trivialism
- Trivialism holds that all propositions are true
	- Antecedent?
	- Examples:
		- The moon is made of cheese
		- My hands are Green
- All positions are a subset of trivialism
	- All propositions you believe to be true, the trivialist also believes to be true
- How do I distinguish myself from a trivialist?

 Skepticism
- A Skeptic must suspend judgement about how his behavior/speech will be communicated to others
	- That means he does not know whether or not he will appear to be a skeptic to others
		- This implies that he has no reason to favor one set of behavior/speech over another set
	- How do I distinguish myself from a skeptic?
		- If the skeptic can reasonable act/behave as if he is has beliefs, because he suspends judgement on how he appears to others, then how can others know if I am skeptic or not?
		- Internal mental content
			- I know first hand that I have beliefs
			- But there is nothing stopping the skeptic from holding various beliefs, because he suspends judgement about what it really means to suspend judgement
				- A skeptic may not have to give up any beliefs, that could be what suspension of judgement is
