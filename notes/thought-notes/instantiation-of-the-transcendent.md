 Instantiation of the Transcendent
Created: --

. The transcendent can be revealed only by itself
. The transcendent was revealed by Jesus Christ
. Therefore, Jesus Christ is the transcendent

Issue with premise :

What is the transcendent? God? -> Holy trinity?

Why can I not simply redefine the transcendent as some other thing only one person revealed, and then say that person is the transcendent?

This goes into metaphysics of the transcendent? Then, need to understand the metaphysical necessities of the transcendent.

What if Jesus was just the first one to realize the transcendent was One/Non-dualistic, then taught people and then they misinterpreted the teaching as ONLY god is the transcendent

. The transcendent is a one/unity
. There is either a transcendent and the creation OR merely a transcendent // But the transcendent must be transcendent of something
. If its transcendent does that mean its not unified?

How is it a metaphysical necessity?
