 Intuiting Math Concepts
Created: --

In math, a concept such as a circle can not be exhaustively defined by a single definition. Understanding concepts comes from a wide variety of perspectives, each with a unique take on things. Often times, just looking at one or two definitions (most often the hyper analytical ones) I come to an absolute blank in understanding. It is required for me to investigate the concept from different teachers who explain it a little differently. 

Better explained gives a guide to [[📃 Developing Intuition For Math - Better Explained|Developing Intuition For Math]] which explains that to understand a mathematical concept you first need to know the reason it exists, what its purpose is, its implementations, etc. From that, you derive an overall "theme" or "intuition" so that you can actually know what the concept is.

In the book[[📘 Rethinking Intuition - DePaul and Ramsey| Rethinking Intuition]] they go over research done on the nature of concepts in human thought. Their conclusion is that concepts are not anything substantial in themselves, but are instead pointers to a set of elements which having varying similarity. The element which shares the most similarity with the most amount of elements represents the exemplar(s). The exemplar(s) are the best elements in the set for defining what the concept is, but do not exhaustively define it. 

Better explained thinks of a math concept as some abstract idea surrounded by a variety of mathematical definitions. This is almost exactly in line with the [[✏️ Abstract Prototypical Category|prototypical]] definition of a concept found in Rethinking Intuition. The variety of mathematical definitions are just the elements of the set the concept is pointing to. The question then, I think, is whether in the case of mathematics the elements of the set (the mathematical definitions) have equal membership, or if they vary in degree of similarity to some exemplar element. 

Take a circle for example: you can draw it geometrically, define it in terms of multiple different equations, or explain its geometric properties in English. Are all of these definitions equal in membership in the set? Maybe the mathematical definitions are the exemplars, and then the circles we encounter in the world are the less prototypical examples, and therefore have varying degrees of similarity. The mathematical definitions are akin to Plato's forms, but not exactly because the set of mathematical definitions has more than  element. 

Is understanding all of the definitions together, holistically, and seeing their interrelation what Plato meant by grasping the forms? I definitely see the hierarchy here:
- Everyday definitions (fuzzy) -> mathematical definitions (exact, but still have multiplicity) -> (abstract, non-physical form?)
	- From left to right, you approach the prototypical
	- From left to right, multiplicity decreases
