  C.S. Lewis' Conception of Christian Sexual Morality
Created: -- :

There is a distinction in Christianity between chastity and sexual modesty. Chasity in a Christian context refers to the act of refraining from sexual intercourse until marriage.
Sexual modesty refers to what kinds of sexual behaviors are acceptable within our current society, and how much of your body is ok to display publicly. By this definition, sexual modesty is a relative. It is stressed in by C.S. Lewis that God will judge you relative to the current standards of sexual modesty, and not by some objective/unchanging standard.

Sexuality as such is completely neutral in Christianity. Sexual indulgence in moderation is respected/glorified, but an overindulgence in sexuality is considered sinful. The idea is that an overindulgence will result in other sins such as concealment, lies, bitterness and jealousy. This also may be classed as a form of idolatry, as one can end up occupying himself with sexuality more than god.

According to C.S. Lewis, Christians see sex as a biological function that has been distorted/perverted. If one were to apply the concept of strip teasing to food, it would obviously appear ridiculous and grotesque for one to drool over food in such a way. Yet, the concept applied to humans is normalized, accepted, and embraced by many. A question arises in regards to our perversions: is it due to starvation or over-indulgence? It appears over-indulgence is the more likely explanation, because there does not seem as if we have restricted access to sexual gratification. In fact, it is as unrestricted as it ever has been.

In order to achieve Chastity, one must recognize how and why our sexual desires have been perverted, and common lies which justify their perversion. C.S. Lewis claims our sexual desires have been warped by propaganda, which has normalized over-indulgence. There is no reason to believe certain behaviors are wrong when everyone in your society does them thinking it is healthy. We tend to think that by not over-indulging, we are repressing natural sexual desires. For C.S. Lewis, this is a misunderstanding of the technical definition of repression. It is referring to suppression, which is not harmful. Repression actually refers to a desire which acts unconsciously. Sexual desire is a conscious desire for most people, meaning we have the ability to deliberately deny it. Through this denial process, we can reach a greater understanding of our sexuality in the same way we understand sleep better when we are awake. Additionally, the repression of natural desires is a normal thing we do already, so it is only a matter of choosing which ones to deny.

Is it impossible to deny our sexuality, given that is is such a strong natural desire? C.S. Lewis claims that many things only seem impossible due to the limitations of our foresight. It is better to assume things are possible and try, instead of assuming the opposite and not trying at all. The latter may very well be a mistake, as we cannot be perfect in our reasoning. It should also be noted that perfect denial is impossible, and God recognizes that. We must rely on God's strength to be as perfect as we can possibly be however.
