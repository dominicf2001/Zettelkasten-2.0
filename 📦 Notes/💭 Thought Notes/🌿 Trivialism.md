# Trivialism
Created: 2022-05-01 12:53


- Think of it like a Boolean function which takes any argument and just returns true
```js
function trivialistResponse(anyProposition){
	return true;
}
```
- Leads to a paradox?
	- All propositions are true, therefore the proposition that all propositions are false is true
- The propositions it makes are [[ðŸ“ƒ Vacuous Truths - Wikipedia|vacuous truths]]
	- Antecedent: All propositions are true
	- If the antecedent is false, then the consequent will always be true
	- Is the antecedent false?
		- The trivialist would agree is it is
- Are all positions subsets of trivialism?
	- Maybe not, because it is in the approach to knowledge, not the knowledge itself
- The trivialist is playing a game of chance in regards to truth
	- Depends on how we define truth?
- ==A trivialist agrees with all of the critiques against it==
