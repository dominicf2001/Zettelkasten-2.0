# Ashoka of India
Created: 2022-05-21

- Ashoka was the third king of the Mauryan empire, which existed from 322 BCE to 185BCE **// Close to the Buddha**
	- Empire stretched from Iran through almost all of India
- Ruled ruthlessly until a war against the Kingdom of Kalinga in 260BCE.
	- "ASHOKA WALKED ACROSS THE KALINGA BATTLEFIELD, LOOKING UPON THE DEATH & DESTRUCTION, & EXPERIENCED A PROFOUND CHANGE OF HEART."
- His empire did not last even 50 years following his death
- Sources of his life are considered less historical than they are legendary
- Conjectured that his association to Buddhism arose when he had a love affair when a daughter (who was Buddhist) in the commercial center of Ujjain
- King's ministers favorited Ashoka to take the crown despite his father's unfavourability
	- After taking the crown, he executed his brothers except the youngest, who became a Buddhist monk
- He was cruel and ruthless early in his reign
	- Delighted in the torture of his subjects
	- Had a prison known as "Ashoka's hell"
- In the invasion of the Kingdom of Kalinga, 100,000 inhabitants were slaughtered, over 100,000 deported, and thousands left to die of famine/disease
- After the war, Ashoka walked across the battlefield, he felt grief and remorse for what he had done
- He proceeded to renounce war and embrace Buddhism
	- The embrace was *not* sudden but gradual
	- Supposed to have:
		- Instituted vegetarianism
		- Gave himself to the people whenever needed
		- Upheld law which benefited *all* classes
- Scholars question how accurate his story is since it mostly comes from Buddhist texts
- The Artashatra (Ashoka's training manual) made it clear that he was supposed to represent himself as a strong king
	- This means he may not have been able to fully implement Buddhism, because he needed to retain his image
	- Evidence that he made no effort in disbanding the military
		- Probably then used for extinguishing rebellions or maintaining peace
