# The Logic of the Cogito
Created: 2022-08-25

- Descartes' formulation of the cogito carried subjective baggage
- A logically formal reformulation is required to distill the cogito down to its essence
- Principle of Sufficient Reason (PSR) is a good starting point, as it is clearly and distinctly known
	- "For all things that exist, there is a sufficient reason they exist"
- What makes a reason sufficient?
	- Nebulous/vague
	- Can get more and more precise, but when is it precise enough?
- To find out, we need to explore the principle of inexistence (PI)
	- "For all things that do not exist, there is a sufficient reason they do not exist"
- Inexistent objects can be proven inexistent through the law of non-contradiction
	- "x is a bachelor and married"
	- "x is round and a square"
- ^ Principle of Inexistent Objects (PIO)
	- **Defines** a sufficient reason for inexistent objects
- Principle of Possibility (PP)
	- "For all things that exist, there is a sufficient reason they do not exist"
	- Asserts all things only "apparently exist"
- Descartes' skepticism is centered around wrestling with the PP
- In order to disprove the PP, we must prove the negation true:
	- "For some x, there is no sufficient reason x does not exist"
	- This is equivalent to finding a counter example to PP
