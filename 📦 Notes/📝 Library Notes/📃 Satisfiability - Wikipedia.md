# Satisfiability
Created: 2022-05-01 14:25

- Satisfiability in mathematical logic
	- If there is some set of values you can set to the variables in an equation to make the equation true
	- Satisfiable: $3 + x = 6$
		- This is true when $x = 3$
	- Not satisfiable: $3 + x = x$
		- There is no value you can set to x which will make this true
- It is a [[semantic]] property because it defines the meaning of the symbols?
- Formally, a formula is satisfiable if it is true for all [[Interpretations in Logic|interpretations]] of the formula?
- Is a formula in propositional logic (If the dog is outside, I will open the door) satisfiable?
	- This is the [[boolean satisfiability problem|Boolean Satisfiability Problem]]
