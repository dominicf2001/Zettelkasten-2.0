# Cycle of Depression
Created: 2022-08-25

- Particular events of similar nature convene, and then the mind abstracts out an identity from the set of those events
- The identity comes with its own filter which:
	1. Repels events which deflate the identity
	2. Absorbs events which inflate identity
- The identity produces thoughts within the mind, and those thoughts are used as fuel for strengthening the identity
- A solution for deflating identity is to detach yourself from your identity
	- Meditation
	- Psychedelics
	- Being out in nature
	- Limiting social media use
