# Developing Intuition For Math
Created: 2022-09-01

## Definitions

- Ideas/things have different definitions based on perspective:
	- Everyday definition
	- Evolutionary definition
	- Biological definition
	- ...
- Your understanding of each definition should be ordered correctly
	- Some definitions only make sense with the context of other understood definitions
- All the definitions describe the same idea!
- Many ideas have a "caveman" definition we come to intuitively, which can then lead to analytic definitions
	- Some ideas do not have the "Caveman definition" (The growth of `e`) (Imaginary numbers)
## Strategy to understand a concept

1. Learn the "theme" of the concept
	- Consult history
	- Why is the concept used?
	- How did the concept come to be?
2. Relate an analytical definition (i.e. an equation) to the "theme"
	- Take it apart
3. Use that relation as well as the "theme" to understand other definitions
	- Generate a *intuitive* and *holistic* understanding

- Tips:
	- Start with *what makes sense*
	- Analyze from a plethora of angles/perspectives
		- Do not spend too much time on one
	- Study **visualizations**
