- Traditional logic holds a **proposition** to be an assertion
- Modern logic holds a **proposition** to be the *meaning* of an assertion (?)

- Categorical proposition: An assertion which contains a predicate asserting something about a subject
- A categorical proposition can be divided into **4 forms**:
	- (A) Universal affirmative (All S is P)
	- (E) Universal negative (No S is P)
	- (I) Particular affirmative (Some S is P)
	- (O) Particular negative (Some S is not P)

- **Contrariety** of two propositions
	- **Can not** be true simultaneously  
	- **Can** be false simultaneously
- **Subcontrariety** of two propositions
	- **Can** be true simultaneously
	- **Can not** be false simultaneously
- **Subimplication**
- **Superimplication**
