# Properties
Created: 2022-10-22

- The consensus on what properties are:
	- Properties are what makes distinct particulars qualitatively similar to one another
		- Snow, clouds, and paper all *instantiate* the property: **being white**
- 4 theories that try to account for properties
	1. Universals
		- A transcendent (abstract existence) or immanent entity (existence only in particulars) which are instantiated in particulars
	2. Tropes
		- Completely individual qualities that are instantiated *only* in one particular 
		- What grounds the resemblance between tropes? Cannot appeal to universals.
	3. Natural classes
		- Anything which is white is contained in the natural class (a set) of "thing which are white"
		- Leads to an overpopulation problem. One particular is a member of a seemingly infinite amount of different classes
	4. Resemblance classes
		- The classes each particular is a member of is determined by its resemblance relations (?) Is this similar to [[📘 Rethinking Intuition - DePaul and Ramsey#Family Resemblances: Page 17 - Rosch and Mervis|prototypical categories]]
- Realism vs Nominalism
	- Do abstract/general/universal entities exist?
	- Or is everything merely a particular?
- The terms are ambiguous
	- If you are a "realist" you can be a realist about properties *or* universals
		- (?) Does this distinguish properties from universals? it seems to depend on your theory of properties
	- If you are a "nominalist" you can deny the existence of abstract objects while accepting the existence of universals or vice versa
	- This article holds nominalist to mean denying universals
- Realism/Nominalism in the context of properties
	- A realist property theory would hold a a **universalist** theory
	- A nominalist property theory comes in two types
		- Medium nominalism: trope theory
		- Extreme nominalism: completely denies all property-like entities
			- Position put forth by Quine completely dismisses the similarity question
- Extreme Nominalist questions how exactly universals *instantiate* properties, whether abstractly or immanently 
	- Ontologically mysterious
- Realist argues that the Nominalist is working backwards, trying to expla
