# Properties
Created: 2022-10-22

- The consensus on what properties are:
	- Properties are what makes distinct particulars qualitatively similar to one another
		- Snow, clouds, and paper all *instantiate* the property: **being white**
- 4 theories that try to account for properties
	1. Universals
		- A transcendent (abstract existence) or immanent entity (existence only in particulars) which are instantiated in particulars
	2. Tropes
		- Completely individual qualities that are instantiated *only* in one particular 
		- What grounds the resemblance between tropes? Cannot appeal to universals.
