# Brian Jenk's Comprehensive Zettelkasten Workflow
Created: 2022-04-20 19:58

* Lay out goals/ideals/major theme of the PKM (personal knowledge management) system
	* What do I want to get out of it?
	* What exactly will be put into it?
	* How grand will this be?
* Quick capture system
	* Way to immediately capture an idea, so that it can be come back to later
	* [[‚úèÔ∏è Networks of Thought]]
* Status tracking
	* Way to track/label notes to indicate their current status:
		* Needs thought out more?
		* Needs fleshed out?
		* Needs connected with other ideas?
		* Needs to be grouped?
* Textual searches
	* Incorporate a symbol system
		* Each symbol associated with a type of note
			* What types of note to have?
	* Overall, think about what it will be like searching through the notes
		* Textualize symbols based on what will be most efficient
* Association traversal
	* Soft link
		* "anything tagged with this tag is in your results"
	* Hard link
		* "this note and the notes directly referenced by it"
	* Need further clarification on the distinction between soft and hard links
* Structural rigidity
	*  Do not go overboard with the file hierarchy
	* Use only a few levels of files
	* Be more associative with notes, and rely on searching
* Temporal components
	* Place to store when a note was written, so notes within the same timeframe can be (linked?) or put together
* Input types
	* Discovery
		* Places where the information is sourced
		* Do we store these?
	* Acquisition
		* The source material itself
	* Storage
	* Marking the acquired material up
		* PDF editor
* Curation (To take items out of a collection and organize them in some way)
	* Zettelkasten link traversal
		* Can use multi-panel view to mimic laying out notes on a desk
			* Notes on the same level together
	* Mark notes for future review
