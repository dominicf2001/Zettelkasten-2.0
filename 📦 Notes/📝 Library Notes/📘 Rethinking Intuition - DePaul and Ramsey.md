# Rethinking Intuition
Created: 2022-04-13 22:13

## A Historical and Metaphilosophical Introduction: Page 3 - Gary Gutting
* Ancient Era
	* Philosophy was the queen of sciences
	* Knowledge of nature was necessary to understand how to live well, and structure society
* Medieval Era
	* Theology was the queen of sciences
		* Philosophy was a handmaiden to theology
	* Knowledge of nature was necessary to understand how to live well, and structure society
* Modern era
	* Science became queen
	* Formal and final causes rejected
	* Embrace of only efficient and material causes
* The modern era could not (and still cannot) account for mind
	* Newtonian type mechanistic explanations could not apply to the mind
		* This caused Descartes to make an ontological distinction between the mind and the body as different substances
		* Mind 
			* That which is intentional and phenomenal
			* Not extended in space
		* Body
			* That which is extended in space and time
* Locke continues off of Descartes
	* What is knowledge according to him?
		* Sense impression of an object
			* This definition retains causal determinacy (efficient cause)
				* Trying to mesh with Newtonian physics
		* Assumptions implicit in this definition
			* Representations of the object are accurate
			* Truth is a representation
* Kant continues off Locke
	* Experience of an object requires concepts and intuitions
		* Concepts
			* The framework for experience / preconditions for the minds experience of the world 
				* Space, time, substance (?), causality
		* Intuition
			* The content of our experience, which are organized according to concepts
	* Caused an epistemological revolution
		* Epistemologies each now had the distinction between formal/a priori/structural/foundational/transcendental truths and a posteroi/contingent/contentual truths
* Many modern criticisms of these new epistemologies emerged out of Kant
* Two groups emerged with regards to intuitional access to reality (Non-empirical truths)
	* Naturalists
		* Rejected it
	* Anti-Naturalists
		* Accepted it (not nearly to the degree of ancients)


## Family Resemblances: Page 17 - Rosch and Mervis
- Traditional analytical definition of a **concept**
	- An identifier for a set of objects who each have **equal** membership
	- Each object shares the same attributes in common

```
C = {a,b,c ... n}

‚àÄx, x ‚àà C, such that x has the attributes: {f, g, h}
``` 

## Prototypical definition of a **concept**
- A set of objects which sufficiently resemble each other to varying degrees
	- Each set has a *best exemplar*
		- Shares the more attributes in common with all members in the set than most members in the set
		- Element in the category which is *most different* from members of other categories
	- Can have multiple exemplars 
		
```
C = {a,b,c ... n}

‚àÄx, x ‚àà C, such that x has some attributes which more or less resemble a best exemplar

‚àÉy, y ‚àà C, such that y has more attributes in common with all members in the set than most other members (y = best examplar)
```

[[‚úèÔ∏è Abstract Prototypical Category]]

- How are prototypical categories formed?
	- Physiologically 
		- Category structured by the innate salience of particular stimuli
	- Artificially
		- Category is structured intentionally/consciously

- Similar to Wittgenstein's family resemblance theory
	- Referents are not related to each-other because they all share common attributes.  
	- Relation instead takes place in this manner:
		-  *Some* attribute(s) of an element X is in common with some attribute of element Y, and *some*  attribute(s) of Y are in common with some attribute of element Z

[[The Semantic Triangle|Referents]]
```
attributes_of_referents = {AB, BC, CD, DE}

AB <-> BC <-> CD <-> DE
```
