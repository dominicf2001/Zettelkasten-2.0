# The Evidence for Jesus Is Worse than You Think
Created: 2022-05-16

- Papyrus 137 "dated to 80 A.D."
	- Claimed to be best evidence for Jesus
	- Held in secret for several years
	- Turned out to be dated much later, and contained very little info
- Gary Habbermas and Daniel Wallace claim we have more than enough evidence for Jesus
- Calibar of evidence for Jesus is not the same as someone like George Washington **//** **Not a fair comparison due to time differences**
- What is the best evidence for Jesus?
	- Body? **No**
	- Tomb location?
		- Speculation, but **no** solid answer
	- Any physical objects associated with him? **No**
	- Contemporary depictions of him? **No**
		- Paintings, sculptures
	- Shroud of Turin (**debunked**)
	- Contemporary first hand written accounts?
		- Gospels?
			- Luke got his information second hand
			- Gospels were **anonymously** written
				- Names attached *afterwards*
				- Were not written by the actual disciples
					- Thus NOT EYEWITNESS
			- Jesus' "words" would have to be translations, because Jesus spoke in Aramic and Gospels written in Greek
		- Paul?
			- Oldest works in New Testament
		- Eye witness as such is unreliable. Much contemporary evidence supporting this
		- Gospels we have now are likely not original
			- Oldest copies are very miniscule fragments from 100-200 CE
			- Can have changed much since first written **// Translation is an aspect?**
- Evidence for Jesus' **existence** is pretty good for other historical figures from his era or before
	- The sufficient amount of evidence required for figures this far back is very low
	- This kind of evidence is **not sufficient** to establish him as God
		- Psychological manipulation highly prevalent
	- If we accept the *miraculous* accounts of Jesus, we would then have to accept the *miraculous* accounts of Caesar and other similar figures
