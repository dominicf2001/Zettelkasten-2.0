# Physicalism
Created: 2022-10-14

## Preliminaries
- Thesis: everything is of physical nature, even those things which do not *appear* to be so, such as politics, psychology, or mathematics
- "Materialism" first appeared in the late 17th century as a *metaphysical* doctrine, whereas "physicalism" first appeared in the 1930s as a *linguistic* doctrine associated with [[Positivism]]
	- Today, the two terms are used interchangeably
- Physicalism appears to be a metaphysical thesis which goes all the way back to [[Democritus]], and later being held by early modern philosophers such as [[Hobbes]]
	- But we must be careful because the notion of "physicality" has changed much throughout history, so their conceptions of "physicalism" may differ greatly
- Two questions about Physicalism:
	1. What do it *mean* for something to be physical 
	2. Is it the case that **everything** is physical
## Is everything physical?
### Modal formulations of Physicalism
#### Supervenience Physicalism
- Physicalism supposes that the psychological/political/biological components are our world *[[supervenience|supervene]]* on physicality
	- Dot matrix analogy
		- ![[depositphotos_85737248-stock-illustration-halftone-dots-radial-with-shadow.webp|300]]
		- Dot matrix has general properties such as "symmetry" or "roundness" which *supervene* on the dots
			- Two dot matrices have identical general properties *if and only if* the individual dots which constitute them are identical
- (1) Thus, if everything is physical ->
	- then every possible world *physically* identical to ours **must be** psychological/politically/biologically identical to ours
- **Objection**
	- The sufficiency problem argues:
		- (1) is a *necessary* property but not a *sufficient one* in proving physicalism
		- A singleton set which contains only Socrates has supervening properties (properties of the set) which are fundamentally different than Socrates himself
	- This leads to necessitation dualism, which claims that mental properties supervene on physical properties, but are nevertheless ontologically *distinct*
		- Apparently violates Hume's dictum: there are no necessary connections between distinct ontological categories
#### Necessity Physicalism
- If everything is physical ->
	- then every property in our world is ultimately *necessitated* by a physical property (it is *entailed by*)
#### Identity Physicalism
- Two types:
	- Token physicalism
		- Every particular in the world is identical to a physical particular
		- Not sufficient or necessary, because there are some particulars which are not identical to physical particulars (those non-identical particulars may still [[#Supervenience Physicalism|supervene]] on physical particulars)
		- Compatible with [[property dualism]] which says **all** particulars are **physical**, but some have *psychological [[🎓 Properties - IEP]]*, which are distinct from *physical properties*
		- Incompatible with [[substance dualism]] which says particulars can either be physical or non-physical
	- Type physicalism
		- Every *property* in the world is IDENTICAL to a physical property
