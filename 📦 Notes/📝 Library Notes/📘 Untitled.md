Created: 2023-03-04

## Chapter 1: The Origin of The Democratic Ideal 
- The origin of the idea of democratic idealism lay far in our past
	- Egypt, Greece, India
	- "Secret dream of the great classical philosophers"
- Material solutions to spiritual problems never work
	- That is why we need spiritual/philosophic leaders to guide us
		- [[egyptian pharaohs]]
- America needs a strong *idealistic* vision of the world
	- It must touch heavily on the core of what it means to be  a human being
	- Collectivist over isolationist/individualist
	- Selflessness over selfishness
	- Spiritual over material

## Chapter 2: The Worlds First Democrat 
- Akhnato, Pharaoh of Egypt, 1388 B.C.
- Courageously opposed the priesthood, founding is own religion of Atonism. 
- Aton is a fatherly, loving god who has created all things.
	- All things have the presence of God within them
	- All things are equally worthy of life, free will, aspirations
- Encouraged pacifism, democracy
- Traveled the lands and treated all of the citizens with equal respect, no matter their class
- His lands were invaded, did not fight back
- Only pharaoh to not display himself on his tombstone as a conqueror
	- Instead as a loving father and husband
	- "The first man in history who dared to dream of the Brotherhood of Men, and he cheerfully gave his life and his empire for that dream"
