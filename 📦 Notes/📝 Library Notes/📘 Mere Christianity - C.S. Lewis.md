## Morality and Psychoanalysis: Page 88
* Have many similarities with eventual divergences
* Moral choices
	* Choosing
		* Go off of our current raw material
		* Deliberate 
	* Raw Material
		* Desires/feelings
		* Natural
			* Hunger, boredom, excitement
		* Unnatural
			* Not a sin but a disease
			* Mental illness
				* Depression, anxiety disorders
			* Out of control emotions
				* Anger, sadness
	* It is the job of psychoanalysis to clear away unnatural psychological material so we can make free choices
		* These free choices are what God judges
			* Relative to the person


## Sexual Morality: Page 94
* Chastity
	* Refraining from sexual intercourse 
* Sexual modesty
	* Relative
		* Judged by God based on relativity
* Sexuality
	* In itself - neutral
	* Over-indulgence - sinful
		* Leads to concealment, lies, bitterness, jealousy
	* Only during marriage - glorified? When done properly
* Biological function of sex has been distorted/perverted
* Strip Teasing
	* Food - strange/perverted/vulgar
	* Humans - normalized
	* Due to starvation or over-indulgence? 
		* Evidence suggests over-indulgence
* Achieving Chastity 
	* Desires have been warped by propaganda
		* Tells us its normal/ and healthy
		* Makes us think we are denying nature
			* Misunderstanding of "Repression"
				* Does not technically mean suppression, instead it means that desire acts *unconsciously*
				* Sexual desire is *conscious* for most, so we can deny it
					* By not perpetually giving in, we can understand it better, in the same way we understand sleep better when awake
			* We do this all the time, its just a matter what we choose to deny
	* Is it impossible?
		* Many things seem impossible
			* Assuming that they truly are is a hindrance
		* Absolute perfection may be impossible, but we do not need to be perfect
			* God will forgive us, and we must rely on his strength


## Christian Forgiveness: Page 115
* In order to be forgiven, we must forgive others
* Forgiveness is a part of loving thy neighbor
	* Neighbor includes enemies
* Start out with easy actions to forgive, then work to harder actions
* Distinction between hating a man and hating his actions
	* We should love a man but hate his actions, because we love him
		* We have this disposition towards *ourselves*
			* Thus we should hate others as you hate yourself
	* Not hating the man does not have to reduce the amount of hate for his actions
* What is good hate?
	* We should not *want* to hate, nor should we *enjoy* hating
		* If we seek it out and enjoy it, our perception will be biased towards what is evil in the world
	* We should should hate actions out of necessity and when it is just
		* Same with punishment
			* Punish others as you punish yourself, give that you are punishing yourself as you should
* The word kill is better translated as murder
	* Murder is killing for a selfish benefit, or for pleasure
	* Kill takes into account justice
		* Thus, can possibly be a holy act to kill 

## The Great Sin: Page 121
* Pride is a sin many are unconscious of
	* Much more than other sins, which many recognize (such as intemperance)
* May lead to any other sin
* Competition is an essential property
	* It is felt superiority/power over others, which is relative
* Seen as one of the greatest sins
* Cannot commune with God if one is prideful
	* It means they must see god as one's superior
* Trivial sins are cured for the sake of pride
	* This is a negative exchange, as pride is ultimately greater than all of the trivial sins which were cured
	* It is a trap, because it appears as if one is doing good
* Fake humility
	* In order to make it appear to God and to others that you are holy
	* This type of sin is a spiritual one, as it is not rooted in animalistic desires
