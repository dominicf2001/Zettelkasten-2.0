# Is The New Testament Reliable
Created: 2022-05-16

- **Over 5,000 early texts that attest to the New Testament**
	- Codices
		- Codex of adicanus ?
		- Codex Vaticanus (4th century)
		- Codex Sinaiticus (4th century) (Earliest complete copy of New Testament)
		- Codex Alexandrian (5th century)
		- Other codices
	- Apostolic letters
	- Papyri
	- Lectionaries
- Earliest writings of Plato are from around 900-1100 AD
	- Same with Aristotle or Tacitus or Caesars Gallic wars
- Attestation is very good considering the early text's proximity, relative to Platonic texts for example
- Was Jesus made up by Constantine or Council of Nicaea ?
	-  Paul spread bible's teaching *orally* to people such as Timothy who then started Churches
	- Teachings and practices (liturgies) of Christianity already very much established before the time of Constantine and Council of Nicaea
- Consistency of writings (**bible references**) of early Church fathers is evidence for the stability of Early Christianity
- Readings:
	- Early lectionaries/liturgies
	- "On the Incarnation of the Logos"
	- Are the New Testament documents reliable? - F.F. Bruce
	- Epistles of Ignatius - Irenaeus
	- Latter section of Against Heresies
	- Gregory of Nazianzus's theological orations (all of them)
	- On the unity of christ
	- "The catechetical lectures" of Saint Cyril of Jerusalem
	- Saint Basal's treatise on the Holy Spirit
	- City of God, St. Augustine
- **Predictions of Isiah**
	- Known to be before Jesus
	- Chapter Two
		- "The laws will be *taught*"
			- Echoed by Jesus in the Sermon on the mount
			- "The Church *is* the kingdom"
	- Chapter Nine 1-8
	- Chapter Eleven 10
	- Chapter Twelve
	- Chapter Nineteen
	- Chapter 25 6-8
	- Idea that God would accept Gentiles seemed crazy before Jesus, yet was prophesized
