# Aza Raskin on AI, language, and Species
Created: 2022-08-25

- In web design, you fail if you make the user do something unnecessary
- Ai relies more on the dataset than the algorithm
	- Faster GPUs good for matrix calculations furthered AI development
- Important aspect of AI is language prediction based on specific input (fill in the blank)
	- Can think about geometrically with vectors
		- Relationship between man and king has certain vector distance and direction. This vector distance and direction would be almost identical for relationship between woman and queen
- Vector distances and directions represent some kind of relationship which can be applied(added/subtracted) across a multitude of words. For each word the vector is applied to, you then get a result of similar relationship. (Example: pretentiousness)
- Similar vector mappings across languages, points towards universality
- Paradoxicality of technological progress
	- The better we understand people with technology or in relation to technology, the easier it is to exploit people
		- Exasperates asymmetrical power and wealth relations
- Language will become a joystick
	- Generation of all media through language
	- Dynamically generated media which is reactive to your emotional state, and/or user input
		- Based on facial data
- Human beings have inherit kindness and inherit hatred, whichever one comes out depends on the context
	- Technology stimulates the hating part of human beings
		- People react strongly to things they strongly dislike
			- When clicking on it, they're entire endless feed fills with stuff they hate
- People's feed causes them to have a narrow and distorted conception of reality
- Many people have conflicting distorted perceptions of reality, and this causes massive discord
- Trust will become a huge issue
	- Ai generated scientific papers against and for certain sides
	- Ai generated news stories
	- Ai is the future of photoshopping
- Twitter bots already pass the Turing test
- Chat bots will far surpass brittle human relationships
	- They become coping mechanisms
- Collective human wisdom is outpaced by technological progress
	- We can hopefully use technology to hyper accelerate our collective wisdom to keep pace
- Benefits
	- Massively decreases time between abstract thought and generation into reality
	- Can have AI tutors based on the work of the worlds smartest minds
