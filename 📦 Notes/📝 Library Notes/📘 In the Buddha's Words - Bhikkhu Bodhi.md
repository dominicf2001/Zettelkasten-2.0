# In the Buddha's Words
Created: 2022-08-25

- Underlying tendencies of humans
	- Aversion to pain
	- Lust for pleasure 
	- Ignorance
- Four (false?) views of self:
	1. Form as in self
	2. Self in form
	3. Self possessing form
	4. Form as self
- Elaborated perceptions -> thinking -> like/dislike -> envy/niggardliness -> hatred/turmoil
- Craving and desire lead to the pursuit of things, which leads to possession, then to defensiveness, and then hostility 
- There is not one singular Buddha
	- Numberless Buddha's preceding ours, and indefinitely more succeeding ours
	- Incarnation of the primordial archetype
		- A light to the darkness of existence, spreads the Dhamma to tormented humans
	- Bodhisatta is a Buddha in training
		- Takes place over many eons
- The Buddha is the pinnacle of instructors not only to the transcendent seeking ascetics but the everyday mundane layman 
- The Buddha on the Eve of enlightenment contemplates the origination of the sufferings of old age and death
- The origination of suffering does not imply immediate joy of interconnectedness
- The Buddha trained under teachers who taught him to dwell in their Dhamma
	- When he reached equal footing he realized there are higher stages, and he was not yet freed from Samsara
- Buddha claims extreme ascetics who put themselves through physical pain doesn't necessarily mean they have given up all of their sensual desire
	- Self mortification will hinder progress
- Happiness not derived from sensual pleasure/unwholesome states is OK
- Four Jhanas
	1. Thought/examination, accompanied by happiness/rapture
	2. Absence of thought/examination, with confidence and full unification of mind, accompanied by happiness/rapture 
	3. Absence of rapture, with Equanimity, mindfulness, and clear comphrension
	4. Pure and fully mindful with no pleasure/pain
- the 3 knowledges
	1. Of the Buddha's past lives, going back eons
	2. Of good and bad beings undergoing rebirth based on their thoughts/actions
	3. Of the four noble truths
- Whereas most religions expect you to take many claims on pure faith alone, Buddhism expects you to simply use your direct experience
- We start with the most primal aspect of our existence: suffering
	- We must first determine it's casual origins
-  Buddha does not claim to reject all others opinions
	- Only trust the opinions of the wise
	- Take into context the Kalamas
- Motivation to do wholesome/good behavior is done out of the **realization** that it will lead to wholesome/good consequences
	- This means good afterlife is not a sole motivator 
- Concerning ourselves first with these immediate empirical realities, and following the Dhamma's prescription, we can reach states of being that allow us to realize the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism
	- Samsara, Khamma and preternatural realms 
- Faith is a key which unlocks the door to practice, and practice will lead to direct realization
	- It is a prerequisite
- We must carefully decide what teachers to put our faith in
	- Determine their level of pure ness through their speech and behavior
- Presently, there are things if lost you would suffer over. There are also things if you lost you would not suffer over. The former is due to desire, the latter due to absence of desire.
- Inquiring into an "enlightened one"
	- Inquire into states perceived by sight and hearing
		- Defilement?
		- Mixed states?
		- Wholesomeness?
		- Cleansed?
		- Dangers connected with fame?
		- Fear?
		- Sensual indulgence?
	- The final conclusion comes when you follow the teacher and let him bring you to sublime states of Dhamma
- We preserve truth but not holding anything come to by faith, reasoned cognition, approval, oral tradition, or acceptance of a view as a result of pondering it as **the one and only truth**
- Steps to discover truth
	1. Investigate the teacher
		- Are his states filled with greed, hate, delusion?
	2. Ponder and accept the teachings
	3. Desire -> will -> scrutiny (Dhukka) -> striving
	- There is yet no final arrival
- In order to reach final arrival you must repeat the previous steps
- Faith is what sets in the motion the discovery of truth
- The Dhamma is a unchanging order of the universe which constitutes truth, lawful regularity and virtue
	- Dhamma manifests itself in the human mind as the aspiration towards truth, beauty and transcendence
	- Dhamma manifests itself in the human body as virtuous speech and action 
	- It is impersonal, and it is what is relied upon by the Buddha or benevolent rulers when they conduct good into the world
- The Buddha promulgated the way of living in accordance with the Dhamma
	- Leads to these 3 benefits:
		1. Good, welfare and happiness attained in your present life as a consequence of attending to ones moral responsibilities
		2. Good, sedate and happiness attained in subsequent lives by acting virtuously
		3. Ultimate liberation (Nibbana) attained by the 8 fold path
- In the society the Buddha is within, there is a high importance placed on the stability and harmony of the immediate family for the harmony of the entire social order
- Societal relationships all depend on each other for their harmony
	- Children to parents depends on wife to husband
- Buddha did not fight against the caste system, but simply did not recognize it
	- Purification is available to anyone
- The righteous king who turns the wheel of the Dhamma
	- A king who rules with the Dhamma as his co-regent
- How a family man is accomplished in moral discipline
	1. Abstains from the destruction of life
	2. Abstains from stealing
	3. Abstains from sexual misconduct
	4. Abstains from false speech
- Six principles of cordiality
	1. Bodily acts of loving kindness
	2. Verbal acts of loving kindness
	3. Mental acts of loving kindness
	4. Generosity
	5. Virtue
	6. Wisdom
- Buddha argues against Brahmin caste being the only ones who are not dark, purified and fully superior
	- His arguments:
		- They are not born from the mouth of Brahma, but from a female's womb
		- Other cultures don't have a Brahmin caste, and are able to change castes. What basis do they deserve absolute superiority?
		- They are just as liable to being reborn in the lower world if they behave immorally as any other caste
		- Any caste can behave morally
		- Any caste can develop loving kindness
- Kharma is the capacity of our actions to generates consequences of equalivant moral value
	- Consequences occur in this life or subsequent lives
- Kharma comes in two forms
	1. Wholesome
		- Mundane - Brings forth wholesome consequences in this life and the next
		- Word-transcending - brings about nirvana and liberation by following the eightfold path
			- Dismantles karmic causation
	1. Unwholesome - brings forth unwholesome consequences in this life and the next
- Karma which is neither dark or bright which leads to liberation is to abandon dark and light karma
- Three types of merit: giving, moral discipline, and meditation
	- Order of important: giving -> moral discipline -> meditation
- It is better to give to one person with view than 1000 people without right view
- Moral discipline includes five precepts
- Meditation incorporates loving-kindness which encompasses everything in the world
	- Includes: equanimity, compassion, and altruistic joy
	- 16 times greater than giving and moral disciple
- Gratification, danger, escape
	- Recognize these in sensual pleasure, form and feelings
		- Sensual pleasure: all five senses
			- Danger: not getting what you want, having to protect what you want, relationship strife, war, thievery, lack of moral discipline
		- Form: beauty/loveliness in a person/object
			- Danger: the beauty/loveliness of a person/object will inevitably decay into ugliness
		- Feelings: happiness and rapture due to freedom from affliction
			- Danger: these feelings are impermanent
- Nirvana is beyond sensual pleasure and divine bliss 
- 4 types of loss which cause one to become a monk
	- Loss through aging
	- Loss through sickness
	- Loss of wealth
	- Loss of relatives
- Buddha's four Dhamma summaries
	1. Life in any world is unstable
	2. Life in any world has no shelter or protector
	3. Life in any world has nothing of its own, all will pass
	4. Life in any world is full of craving and suffering
- Wrong view
	- Denial of morality and free will 
- People mistake parts for the truth as the whole truth, and quarrel with others who believe another part of the truth is the whole truth (elephant allegory)
- Two kinds of wrong views
	1. Holding back
		- Delighting in their existence, they ignore the cessation of their existence
	2. Overreaching
		- Lamenting in their existence, they entirely despise their existence
- Right view: see what comes to be, become dispassionate with what comes to be
- We have shed more tears/bloods in our course of rebirth over torturous circumstances than all of the water in the oceans
- The Buddha only declares that which is beneficial towards Nirvana
- He leaves undeclared those views which hinder one's spiritual life, and which do not lead to Nirvana
	- "Is the world infinite or finite?"
	- "Is the soul the same as the body, or seperate?"
	- "Does the Tathagata continue to exist after death?"
- Those in search of Nirvana obtain benefits such as financial gain and renown, and become complacent

- People in their spiritual journey can become complacent at different levels of attainment
